To investigate this, we can analyze the distribution of positive and negative reviews over time. By examining how these proportions change in the months following the ceremony, we can determine whether the awards create a lasting impact or if public sentiment stabilizes quickly after the initial buzz.

<br>

Letâ€™s plot and analyze the evolution of these distributions to gain deeper insights into the post-ceremony dynamics. Let's start by comparing all the positive and negative review scores:

<div class="plot-container">
  {% include question2/density_distrib.html %}
</div>

<h4> Globally </h4>

We observe that the distribution of positive reviews spikes immediately after the ceremony, whereas negative reviews are more evenly distributed throughout the first year. After one year, the two distributions converge, becoming quite similar.

<br>

This suggests that many positive reviews are posted right after of the Oscar ceremony when the "hype" is still present, reflecting the excitement and approval generated by the awards. On the other hand, negative reviews seem to decrease more gradually over time, indicating a slower decline in critics compared to the initial burst of positivity.

<h4> Non-winning movies </h4>

There is a small spike in positive reviews, which could suggest that the distributions are different. As globally, the two distributions converge over time and become similar towards the end.

<h4> Winning movies </h4>

Examining the plot, it appears that the positive reviews show a higher and more sustained spike compared to negative reviews, particularly around the event of the Oscar ceremony (day 0). While both distributions exhibit a decay over time, the differing trends imply that winning movies tend to garner a relatively higher proportion of positive reviews in the period surrounding the Oscars. This could be attributed to the increased visibility and acclaim associated with the win, which may lead to a stronger positive bias in reviews.

Yes! let's do the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, which compares the underlying continuous distributions \(F(x)\) and \(G(x)\) of two independent samples.

<h4> Globally </h4>
The KS test yields a p-value smaller than 0.05. This result leads us to reject the null hypothesis, which assumes that the two distributions are similar.

<br>

This suggest that there is a significant difference between the distributions, reinforcing the idea that the sentiment dynamics for the two samples are distinct.

<h4> Non-winners </h4>

It seems that the difference between the distributions is less significant in this case, as suggested by the KS test. The test indicates that we cannot reject the null hypothesis (P-Value bigger that 0.05), meaning we cannot confirm that the distributions for positive and negative reviews are different.

<br>

Although the plot shows a small spike in positive reviews, similar to the previous patterns observed, the KS test suggests that both positive and negative review numbers decay over time in a similar manner for the losing movies. This implies that, for these films, the review trends for both types of sentiment follow a comparable pattern over time.

<h4> Winners </h4>

For the winning movies, the KS test yields a p-value of 0.011. Unlike the case with losing movies, this result indicates that we can reject the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level, suggesting that the distributions of positive and negative reviews for winning movies are significantly different.

<br>

In contrast to losing movies, for which the sentiment patterns over time were more comparable, this finding highlights how the prestige of an Oscar win can distinctly influence the compound score dynamics of reviews over time.
